Nitron is a privacy-focused web browser, with the right amount of security added for *Peace of Mind*!

## Reasons For Making This Browser
I've wanted a browser that had the privacy that a human being should need, with the same old familiar look that your used to.

## Things that will NOT be in Project Nitron
Below is a list you *may* use if you already use Google Chrome. Since I want my browser to be as secure and give the user the most privacy as possible, the items will not be included.

- Any Internal and External Use of Google Domains and Services (Google Docs, Google Cloud Messaging, etc.)
- Fingerprinting (Unique Data when accessing a website)
- Restore Pages dialog box
**To put it simply, anything to do with getting a user's unique data, and Google services will not be in the browser by force**
